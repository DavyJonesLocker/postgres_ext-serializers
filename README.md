## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'postgres_ext-serializers'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install postgres_ext-serializers

## Usage

Just `require 'postgres_ext/serializers'` and use
ActiveModel::Serializers as you normally would!
Postgres\_ext-serializers will take over anytime you try to serialize an
ActiveRecord::Relation.

### Methods in Serializers and Models

If you are using methods to compute properties for your JSON responses
in your models or serializers, postgres\_ext-serializers will try to
discover a SQL version of this call by looking for a class method with
the same name and the prefex `__sql`. Here's an example:

```ruby
class MySerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  def full_name
    "#{object.first_name} #{object.last_name}"
  end

  def self.full_name__sql(scope)
    "first_name || ' ' || last_name"
  end
end
```

The scope is passed to methods in a serializer, while there are no
arguments passed to `__sql` methods in a model. You will not have access
to the `current_user` alias of `scope`, but the scope passed in will be
the same object. Right now, this string is used as a SQL literal, so be
sure to *not* use untrusted values in the return value. This feature may
change before the 1.0 release, if a cleaner implementation is found.

## Developing

To work on postgres\_ext locally, follow these steps:

 1. Run `bundle install`, this will install all the development
    dependencies
 2. Run `rake setup`, this will set up the `.env` file necessary to run
    the tests and set up the database
 3. Run `rake db:create`, this will create the test database
 4. Run `rake db:migrate`, this will set up the database tables required
    by the test
